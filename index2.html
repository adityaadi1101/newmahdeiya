   <li>A village is a place that is far away from the pollution and noise of the city. </li>
   <li> Also, you feel a connection with the soil in a village</li>
   <li> Around more than 70% of Indiaâ€™s population resides in villages. Likewise, villages are the main source of food and agricultural produce that we consume.</li>
   <li>Village peoples are more dedicated to their work then the people of the city also they have more strength and capacity then urban area people.</li>    
   <li>Moreover, the entire village lives in peace and harmony and there is no conflict of any kind.</li>
